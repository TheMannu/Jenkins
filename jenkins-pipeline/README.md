## A simple jenkins pipeline to verify if the docker slave configuration is working as expected.

 ### Project Steps:
1. **Setting up Jenkins with Docker as Agent:**
   - Started by installing and configuring Jenkins on an AWS EC2 instance.
   - Installed Java as a prerequisite for Jenkins installation.
   - Configured incoming traffic rules in the AWS security group to expose Jenkins on port 8080.
   - Used Docker as an agent in Jenkins pipeline for lightweight and flexible container usage.

2. **Implementing Jenkins Pipeline:**
   - Created a Jenkins pipeline to verify Docker slave configuration with a simple node.js application.
   - Deployed the node.js application in a Docker container using Docker pipeline plugin.
   - Demonstrated the dynamic creation and deletion of Docker containers during pipeline execution.

3. **Multi-Stage, Multi-Agent Pipeline:**
   - Enhanced the pipeline to support multi-tier architecture with different language requirements.
   - Demonstrated the usage of multiple Docker containers as agents for specific tasks in the pipeline.
   - Executed stages for Java, node.js, and MySQL applications, showcasing versatility and efficiency.

4. **CI/CD with Kubernetes Deployment using Argo CD:**
    - Integrated Python application with Jenkins for CI/CD process.
    - Built a Docker image of the Python application and pushed it to Docker Hub.
    - Updated the deployment.yaml file for the Kubernetes cluster with the new Docker image version.
    - Utilized Argo CD as a declarative continuous delivery tool to monitor and deploy changes in the Kubernetes cluster.

### Learnings:
- Understanding the importance of using Docker containers as agents in Jenkins for efficient and scalable CI/CD workflows.
- Implementing multi-stage pipelines for complex multi-tier applications with different language requirements.
- Deploying applications to Kubernetes clusters using Argo CD for automated and reliable continuous delivery.
- Handling worker node issues efficiently by leveraging Docker containers dynamically.

### Description:
The project focused on leveraging Jenkins for CI/CD processes, utilizing Docker containers as lightweight agents, and integrating with Kubernetes for efficient deployment. It showcased the automation of tasks, dynamic container creation, multi-stage pipelines, and advanced deployment strategies using Argo CD. The implementation emphasized best practices for orchestrating complex application workflows with flexibility, scalability, and reliability in mind. The project highlighted the significance of modern tools and techniques in DevOps practices for streamlined development and deployment workflows.
